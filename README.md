## **Project Overview**

This website is an interactive digital showcase of the Blue Mountains, created as part of my MMCC2041 coursework. It combines firsthand observations from my visit with technical implementation using front-end web technologies.

The site is designed to:
- Present the natural beauty and cultural significance of the Blue Mountains
- Demonstrate practical skills in web development, interactivity, and design
- Reflect on the connection between place, experience, and digital storytelling

## **Motivation & Reflection**

Visiting the Blue Mountains left a lasting impression on me. The moments of quiet observation and hands-on exploration shaped how I think about place, environment, and narrative. This project grew naturally from that experience—it allowed me to combine what I learned in the field with the technical skills I've developed in this unit.

I believe this is an ideal project because it links personal experience with academic learning: the site communicates firsthand observations while demonstrating practical JavaScript, jQuery, and web design skills required by the assessment. It's both meaningful to me and a solid piece of coursework.
