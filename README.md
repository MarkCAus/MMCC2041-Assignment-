# MMCC2041 Project

Project Name : The Blue Mountains Australia.

Student ID: 48278157

Overview :

Personal reflection
Visiting the Blue Mountains left a lasting impression on me. Those moments of quiet observation and hands-on exploration shaped how I think about place, environment, and storytelling. This project grew naturally from that experience: it lets me combine what I learned in the field with the technical skills I’ve developed in this course.

I believe this is an ideal project because it links my personal experience with my student learning: the site communicates first-hand observations while demonstrating practical JavaScript, jQuery and web design skills required by the assessment. It’s both meaningful to me and a solid piece of coursework.


This project was created using a combination of AI assistance and the practical skills I developed throughout the unit.
While the core concepts, structure, and implementation were guided by the knowledge and techniques I learned in class. Together, these elements contributed to a project that is both personally significant and academically rigorous.



Incorperation of: 
- Correct and valid use of HTML5
- An absence of deprecated HTML tags
- Correct use of CSS
- Use of jQuery and JavaScript to achieve user interaction
- The first page you want the user to see must be index.html
- Images must be optimized for the Web
- Encouraged to connect their websites to other relevant content, which includes external websites as well as those created by other students, so take some time to see what else is happening in the class.
